I just installed Manjaro, but I can't get the WiFi to work. I have an Intel 9260, which shows up as an unknown device in the hardware detection. I tried to install the driver manually by downloading a Linux version from Intel's website and following the instructions in the README. I typed the command into the terminal (sudo cp ~/Desktop/iwlwifi.34.ucode /lib/firmware) and there was no error. I restarted the computer, but it still Installs the Intel® Network Adapter drivers release 23.5.2 for Windows®.

Since you're the most Linux-savvy folks I can think of, I thought I could turn to you. I have bought a Trekstor Surfbook A13B which uses an Intel wireless AC 3165 wifi card. This card is wired to the PCB in a weird way, basically the Bluetooth module is connected through a PCI lane but the wifi part is wired to the USB bus. I cannot for the life of me find a way to get wifi working in Linux. I've tried all the solutions. ROG Strix GeForce® RTX 2080 OC edition 8GB GDDR6, made for driving 4K display resolution and VR.

Most other distros do. Could someone walk me through the process. I can use a wired ethernet connection to setup if needed. Thanks again.

My laptops wifi card died recently and showed code 43 in the device manager, which isn't specific. Since its a laptop, I can't remove the card, and restarting the laptop hasn't worked. Tried to get drivers onto a USB to update drivers, but the intel software they direct you to only lets you download stuff for devices on the pc/laptop. How would I get the drivers on my laptop that can no longer connect to the internet? Or if I'm going about this wrong, what's the actual way to fix the problem.

I tried building but it got a symbol problem. I did post elsewhere but in vain. can anybody take over and try to fix the errors ? amp#x200B; the current error : amp#x200B; kxld\ net.rpeshkov.IntelWifi\ : The following symbols are unresolved for this kext: kxld\. I've been having high memory usage at idle (around 50%). I've done almost everything to my computer, from memtest86 to updating all the drivers. Now I've identified the problem as intel wifi drivers, but I cannot find the right driver to update it to. Poolmon identified the tag and it belogs to: Cmd findstr locations: Windows\WinSxS\amd64\_dual\_netwbw02.inf\_31bf3856ad364e35\_10.0.17763.1\_none\_40d06d764c448de5 and Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\netwbw02.inf\_amd64\_1c. amp#x200B; as they say, to whom it may concern. amp#x200B; this is the way I was able to install Adelie from the full beta2 iso on my two laptops, old compaq presario 32 bit with broadcom wifi card (driver b43) and dell inspiron 64 bit with intel wifi (driver iwlwifi). amp#x200B; first off, on the dell the 64 bit iso won't boot, so at the grub menu I did: \gtc (to get the menu) \gtls (to see partitions, my usb was fd) \gtset root=(fd,1) \gtchainloader +1 \gtboot. Hello, I just purchased the XPS15 9570 and has currently experienced extreme ping spikes. I tried to reset the computer, and even got a new router but it didn't work. I've heard that we can solve this problem by changing the killer wifi card to intel AC9260 so I'm planning to do that soon. However, I have a couple questions I would like to ask before I start. 1: Do I need to uninstall the killer driver/software? 2: Should I install the driver before or after I replace the wifi card? I have an ASUS RT-AC88U Router. I have a computer with an Intel AC-9650 Wifi card. It seems that both are capable of a faster connection than 867Mbps but I appear to be stuck at that. Signal strength is basically 100% (5 feet from router) in Windows 10 Pro. Latest Intel wifi driver (20.100.0, also tried 20.80.0.1991 from MSI, my motherboard maker). I am 100% sure this is on my 5Ghz connection (My 5Ghz SSID is different than my 2.4Ghz SSID). So are there settings, configuration, features I just got my y740 but my download speed sucks. Its always around 1.3 mb/s (on my other computer with the same wifi it's around 8 mb/s). Someone told me it's because of the killer wifi driver and I should install the Intel driver instead because killer is just a rebranded Intel chip. But how exactly do I do that? I can't find the 8ntel driver anywhere. Also, is this wifi card really just bad or is it really because of the driver. I need help :( A few weeks ago, I would intermittently be unable to connect to wifi after my laptop fell asleep, after restarting, or after shutting down and shutting on. Over time, the frequency of this problem began to increase. To be more specific, I received the warning "This device cannot start (Code 10)". My wifi adapter is the Intel AC 9560. In an attempt to fix the problem, I tried resetting the BIOS and even factory resetting my laptop at least four times. I then tried installing. UPDATE : The ticket I started with Asrock got some attention. They are sending me a new bios chip 2/28/18 Been trying to figure this out for about 2 weeks now with both of my Asrock motherboards; have seen numerous users on the Asrock forums with this same issue DPC_Watchdog_Violation BSOD during any minor WIFI usage. Both have fresh installs 1709 W10Pro; latest Intel wifi drivers. Same problems both boards. No issues using internet via the ethernet port. issue only comes 
so i got mine repaired and received it yesterday, but somehow in someway it happened again today, i did restart it and it seems to be working fine, but with the way this shitty WiFi is disconnecting i think it will happen again, so no point in restoring or using recovery option since it will still happen, so for the last time I'm going to wait and see, if it disconnects again then im buying the intel 9260 which is basically the same thing but just 0.3 gms heavier which is basically insignificant. I’ve googled it and found nothing. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the adapter but it still does not work. I’ve restarted my computer after doing it as well and still nothing. The only way I can access the Internet is with an Ethernet cable and I’m not around one most of the day as I am a student. Does anyone know why this is happening and how to fix this issue. Thank you in advance Edit: Also Under the device status it says “This device cannot start. (Code 10)”. I found this youtube video with the link but it looks like it no longer works, does anyone have the correct link to the wifi drivers? Thanks in advance. I've looked everywhere, but it does not seem like there is a straight forward solution to this? I got a package of drivers from a video (Sebinouse build), but couldn't get it working. amp#x200B; I did a clean installation of Mojave, now how should I go about adding my custom drivers. 
I was playing an online game on my laptop. Suddenly the game started to lag really bad and i was kicked from the match. It said i wasn't connected to the internet. I exit the game to find the WiFi icon in the taskbar replaced with the ethernet icon with a red X next to it. It's like my laptop didn't have a WiFi card. I check device manager to see a yellow exclamation next to the intel wireless ac 9560 driver. The properties showed a code 10 error. amp#x200B; I tried updating the driver. Pushed GPO that scheduled an immediate task to run a powershell script that looks for and changes a registry setting for intel wifi drivers to prefer 5ghz. I'm not seeing this GPO have any effect. I THINK it's because the driver is never fully reloaded without a restart. It's unlikely that any of the machines are being restarted, rather just shut down. I've never been a fan of "Fast startup" and turn it off on my personal machines, but it's turned on by default for ~1000 of our machines </p>

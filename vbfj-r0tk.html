                            <p> Just a quick feedback. Is it only me or was it just weird that r0tk took the DL trophy first, right in front of the players. I follow the professional scene and I fully understand his importance/influence and legacy on Chinese dotes (and being the drafter for VG), but seeing him taking front and grabbing that trophy just seemed weird/selfish/ego infused move. At the end of the day players are the ones that delivered. - VG.J lineup = roTk, HYM, Fenrir, AGGRESIF and 1 new mid player - Xu Zhi Lei a k a BurNIng to Invictus Gaming (Xxs and Boboka possible leave) - EHOME last support player probably Chuan consequently make LANM to POS 5 - Faith likely will go to Newbee / LGD / iG, uuu9 probably to Newbee - 430 may goes to off competitive for 6 months like MMY but if BurNIng want to continue fight at iG, he will consider it. - Cty WILL NOT JOIN ANY TEAM until next transfer window. - He left VG and want to become coach but organization urged him to stay (VGR will become VG first squad and old VG demoted to second squad and change name to VG.J) - BurNIng will be returned to INVICTUS GAMING to reform team with 430 (say that iG still lack pos 3 and support) Source (in case some redditor faggot here say THIS is fake shit and bla bla bla ) : http://dota2.uuu9.com/201609/527599.shtml.

The Main Event (June 6-12, 2016) will be held at the Mall of Asia Arena in Manila, Philippines. 12 Invited teams and 4 qualifier teams from around the world will compete. I know it is a bit too late to post this, but I thought those guys have retired? Why are they back to competitive scene. Kreygasm. Can I just shout out Cty and EHOME for a fantastic game 1 against Secret, where Cty managed to come back against a really farmed artour SF, and just completely dominated the game. The whole team played well too, with a draft that really allowed the Storm to thrive, and it was so satisfying to see EHOME beat the almighty Secret and to shut up their fangays. A great match, and here's to hoping EHOME go far! I came into TI with an anti-eastern mindset, still scarred by the horrors Are Valve going to sell them? Should I check. Directly translated from Chinese dota2 forum (SGamer) Original post ( here ampnbsp; Traditionally, there are two types of carry. One would be a very strong late game carry that farms almost the whole game and win very late. And the other one would be the carries that participate in fights and skirmishes early. And there are no clear boundaries between the two. A lot of late game carries have to fight early, and a lot of early fighting carries.

This would probably be a field day for a dream interpreter if I didn’t actually have a black cat and a python. The thing that was kind of weird though, is that it was my precious python that became three headed, and I found I had an aversion to her that way. My beautiful girls, for reference, of course.

Selling 2 brand new BampR bands. Purchased these 2 weeks ago but accidentally ordered the wrong size. I have a 7" wrist and they were just a bit too big for me. They still fit, but they were just a bit too loose for my liking. I was unable to return to them in exchange for a different size since I installed the bands and tried them on once. So my loss is your gain. Please let me know if you have any questions about these! Thanks!
